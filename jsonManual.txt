This is how JSON file of parameters is designed:

"numeral" category means users should input some numbers and we will give users a text input box to input the number.
all numeral paramerters' name are followed by a number or '*', which indicate how many numbers the user should input.

TO DO: We should check whether the user's input is valid(we also need to have a format and i have no idea).

"selectable" category means users should select some options from a dropdown menu.(something like "true","false" or "valid","same" ...)

TO DO: Fuck off, "padding" in Conv block can receive numeral input or selectable input ("same","valid"), and I have to handle that.
